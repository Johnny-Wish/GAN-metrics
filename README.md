# Scoring the performance of GANs
This project is meant for evaluating GAN performances (Generative Adversarial Network). 

# Features Supported
- Scoring GAN performances with these metrics:
    * Inception Score [to be completed]
    * 1-NN (One Nearset Neighbor) Score [basically done]
    * MAE (Mean Average Error) of pixel-wise color std and mean [basically done]
- Comparing two GANs against a common real distribution [basically done]
- Plotting the evolution of GAN performance as training proceeds [to be implementd]
